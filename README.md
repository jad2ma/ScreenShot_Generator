## What It Does

- Visual editor with live preview
- iOS and Android output support
- Multi-language project setup
- Shared renderer for browser preview and PNG export
- Project-based asset and config management

> [!NOTE]
> This project started as a script-first screenshot generator. Later on a
> generated frontend was attached to it. The frontend has been iteratively
> refined over time, and the history is documented in
> [docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md](docs/PROJECT_HISTORY.md).

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome not found

Set PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH if Chrome is not auto-detected.

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="C:\Path\To\chrome.exe"
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
export PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/path/to/chrome"
```

### Fonts not loading

Generation needs network access for Google Fonts URLs in project theme settings.
